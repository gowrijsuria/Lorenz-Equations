Chaos and Strange Attractors - The Lorenz Model

Most real world phenomenon like weather, fluid flow and economics exhibit random states of disorder and are chaotic in nature. In this project, we present the Lorenz system to model the chaotic behaviour of dynamic systems and also show that small changes in initial conditions produce large changes in long-term outcome, leading to chaos. We studied various characteristics of the model such the steady state conditions, period doubling window etc. Additionally, we also simulated the lorenz model to study the effects of varying different parameters. The Malkus Waterwheel (Lorenz Mill) was also shown as an application of the lorenz system.
